I will be demonstrating how to analyze a memory dump from your PC in Volatility Workbench to check for malware.

Memory Dump: A memory dump is a process in which the contents of memory are displayed and stored in case of an application or system crash. Memory dump helps software developers and system administrators to diagnose, identify and resolve the problem that led to application or system failure.

Fornesics Based Definition: A memory dump (also known as a core dump or system dump) is a snapshot capture of computer memory data from a specific instant. A memory dump can contain valuable forensics data about the state of the system before an incident such as a crash or security compromise.

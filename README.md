# What is the Volatility Foundation? #

An independent non-profit organization. The main mission is to promote the use of volatility and memory anaylisis within the forensics community, as well as to defend the project's itellectual property and longevity.

# Why was the Volatility Foundation formed? # 

The volatility foundation was formed to defend against large corporations and individuals who attempt to exploit open source communities for their own self-interest, as well as to protect all open-source contributers that have sacrificed their time to contribute to the worlds most advanced memory forensics platform.

# How do I get involved with the Volatility Foundation? #

- Contribute to the open source code
- Attend an Open Memory Forensics Workshop

# OMFW 

- OMFW is the ony digital forensics workshop focused on providing a venue to advanced digital investigators.
- Oppurtunity to learn from researchers and practioners who have shaped the field of memory anaylsis.

# WHY OMFW? 

- They limit attendees to ensure the venue is intimate and encourages participation and collaborative discussion.
- Peer relationships: being surrounded by like-minded individuals whose goals are to take on challenging problems.
- Expert researchers and practioners: Oppurtunity to learn about the current innovative research, and what challeges professionals are facing in memory anaylsis.
- Cost: $50 to sign up, all proceeds go to charity
- Invited speakers that present relevant information in "lightning talks", and at the end of each talk their is time set aside to discuss the specific details of their presentaion

# Ok, but what else? #

- You can demonstrate your creativity, and knowledde of memory anaylsis by getting involved with Volatility contests.
